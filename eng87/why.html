<h1>Why Did You Choose Engineering?</h1>
    <h2>Angel Coronado</h2>
        <p>I chose engineering because I want the chance to challenge myself and improve the world around me. What motivates me is the hope that one day I can leave a positive impact on the world around me in some way. Mainly, I want to innovate flight technology to make air travel faster and more accessible in the future. This desire pushed me to Aerospace Engineering which allows me to observe and innovate the way objects move through and interact with fluids.</p>
    <h2>Andres Cruz</h2>
        <p>I want to be on the bleeding-edge of technology, pushing the stories of science-fiction into reality. Attaining an engineering degree is the main stepping stone in my journey to working on advanced technology. Personally, I would prefer to work on AI incorporation into robotics or AI incorporation into rovers, propulsion systems, launch systems, etc. In the end, although engineering is very challenging and stress-inducing, itâ€™s also very fulfilling as a career choice.</p>
    <h2>Christian Aguilar</h2>
        <p>I worked at KFC last summer and it scared me straight. Thank u Colonel Sanders. I chose engineering to flex on the north campus majors. I enjoy solving problems, and problem solving is one of the most important aspects of engineering. With this in mind, I thought that a career in engineering would be a great way to give practical application to my interest. In addition, I would like the work that I do to positively impact others. In engineering, I can design and develop products that help make the lives of others easier. In particular, Computer Science and Engineering interests me because it involves finding innovative ways to make computers do useful tasks that could range from (relatively) simple apps to massive projects involving artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
