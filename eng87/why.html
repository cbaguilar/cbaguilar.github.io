                <p>I chose engineering because I want the chance to challenge myself and improve the world around me. What motivates me is the hope that one day I can leave a positive impact on the world around me in some way. Mainly, I want to innovate flight technology to make air travel faster and more accessible in the future. This desire pushed me to Aerospace Engineering which allows me to observe and innovate the way objects move through and interact with fluids.</p>

                <p>I want to be on the bleeding-edge of technology, pushing the stories of science-fiction into reality. Attaining an engineering degree is the main stepping stone in my journey to working on advanced technology. Personally, I would prefer to work on AI incorporation into robotics or AI incorporation into rovers, propulsion systems, launch systems, etc. In the end, although engineering is very challenging and stress-inducing, it’s also very fulfilling as a career choice.</p>

                <p>I worked at KFC last summer and it scared me straight. Thank u Colonel Sanders. I chose engineering to flex on the north campus majors. I enjoy solving problems, and problem solving is one of the most important aspects of engineering. With this in mind, I thought that a career in engineering would be a great way to give practical application to my interest. In addition, I would like the work that I do to positively impact others. In engineering, I can design and develop products that help make the lives of others easier. In particular, Computer Science and Engineering interests me because it involves finding innovative ways to make computers do useful tasks that could range from (relatively) simple apps to massive projects involving artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

            <h2>Karla Bonilla</h2>
                <p>Same as other engineers, I was attracted to engineering for its importance of problem solving and crave a profession in which I can create tangible solutions. I continue to grapple between my interest in various fields within engineering. I’m obligated to care for the pressing issue of maintenance of existing structures. In the western world, we take much of our infrastructure and transportation for granted so I hope to alleviate some of that burden. However, my innate curiosity for space exploration urges me to work with more exciting satellite systems.</p>
