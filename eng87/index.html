    <p>“Engineers transform individual lives and the contours of communities, altering the form of all dimensions of our lives, including communication, transportation, and education through the artifacts and technology they produce” (Murphy 1).</p>
    <p>Whenever any building has some form of heating or cooling, a mechanical engineer was likely involved in the design. Almost every habitable structure employs some form of heating, cooling, or ventilation. As a result, the HVAC industry maintains a steady demand for skilled mechanical engineers.</p>

        <p>Growing need for more engineers:</p>
        <p>As baby boomers retire, the U.S. industry faces a new wave of retirements;</p>
        <p>We must address the engineering skills gap which refers to the difficulty employers are facing in their search for professionals with in-demand engineering skills;</p>
        <p>Many high-tech companies report that they cannot find qualified U.S. citizens to fill critically important engineering and technology jobs, including in manufacturing;</p>
        <p>We need a new generation of brilliant engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs to create a vibrant future, just as preceding generations did.</p>
