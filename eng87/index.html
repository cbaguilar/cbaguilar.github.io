    <p>“Engineers transform individual lives and the contours of communities, altering the form of all dimensions of our lives, including communication, transportation, and education through the artifacts and technology they produce” (Murphy 1).</p>
    <p>Engineers choose which problems to solve and their importance in contributing to a change for the better, even in a small way. The lasting impact on the community ranges from providing basic life necessities like clean water, sanitation, shelter and electricity to raising the standard of living through new innovations.</p>

        <p>Growing need for more engineers:</p>
    <ul>
         <li>As baby boomers retire, the U.S. industry faces a new wave of retirements;</li>
         <li>We must address the engineering skills gap which refers to the difficulty employers are facing in their search for professionals with in-demand engineering skills;</li>
         <li>Many high-tech companies report that they cannot find qualified U.S. citizens to fill critically important engineering and technology jobs, including in manufacturing;</li>
         <li>We need a new generation of brilliant engineers, researchers, and entrepreneurs to create a vibrant future, just as preceding generations did.</li>
