        <p>One of my main regrets in college was not selecting a more tangibly physical engineering degree
	as my major or minor field of study. I love computer science, but without interaction with the physical
	world is mostly just flowcharts and text. I now have the lofty goal of gaining the level of understanding
	of Electrical engineering roughly equivalent to an undergraduate student at the University of California.
	I will aim to track my learning here for my own accountability and to share my learning resources
	with other people.</p>


        <p>
	I have choesen to skip the courses that I already took in my Computer Science curriculum. Following UCLA's
	curriculum as a model, I have already completed the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Single and Multivariable Calculus</li>
		<li>Linear Algebra</li>
		<li>Differential Equations</li>
		<li>Physics 1-3</li>
		<li>Statistics and Probability</li>
		<li>Introduction to digital circuit design</li>
	</ul>

	This leaves me with the following subjects to self-study:
	<ul>
		<li>Circuit Theory 1-2</li>
		<li>Systems and Signals</li>
		<li>Digital Signal Processing</li>
		<li>Electromagnetics for Engineering</li>
		<li>About eight more core courrses and a design project</li>
	</ul>
