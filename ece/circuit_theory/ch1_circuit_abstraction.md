# Chapter 1: The Circuit Abstraction

*I am somewhat familiar with this subject from physics class and taking a very
elementary introduction to Electrical Engineering course at UCLA.*

What I understand so far: There is a lot of nasty physics
(and even chemistry...) involved in the lower level mechanics of electrical
engineering. The physical phenomena of moving electrons is very interesting and
allows us to do some fun things like scroll through an endless feed of
mind-numbing short videos on our phones. The challenging part is that
actually concerning ourselves with the physical states of trillions
of electrons can be very taxing. We humans have discovered a very nice
model that abstracts away this physical pattern into a much cleaner
concept of an *electrical circuit*, with certain immutable constraints that
must hold on any electrical circuit due to the laws of physics.
