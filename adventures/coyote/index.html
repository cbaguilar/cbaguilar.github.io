<p>New Year’s day, 2019, was my first ever backpacking trip without an adult
    to guide me, or so it seemed. In truth, I had just turned eighteen and I was 
    the guide.</p>



<p>My friend and I had been planning this trip for months. I was a
fairly experiened former Boy Scout, but my friend had never spent
a night in the backcountry before. We decided on a route we were
certain would be snow free: the de Anza trail through Coyote Canyon.</p>

<p>
My friend arrived at my house on New Year’s Eve.
We geared up, I submitted private school applications at midnight,
and we headed out early the next day.</p>

<p>
My parents and my younger brother accompanied us to the trailhead.
They would spend the two days car-camping while we traveled on the
old route taken by Mexican settlers two centuries ago.
It had snowed overnight, and the town of Anza was covered in a light dusting.
The closer we got to the trailhead, the more snow there was.
I was nervous, as I had never camped in the snow before.
My mom was understandably apprehensive, but with her blessing,
we did finally leave the trailhead. It would be about fifty hours until
we would have cell reception again.</p>

<p>
During the first hours of the hike, my friend and I took our time and absorbed
the stunning desert landscape. But as soon as we began descending,
a biting wind whipped us from across the snow-capped mountains.
We persisted on our trek to Bailey’s Cabin, our first night’s destination.
I wonder what went through my friend's head as he trusted me to guide him
through one of the most remote areas of the desert. I’m not sure if I
would have the same faith in my abilities that he did.</p>


<p>
After several miles of hiking through an unmarked wash, we arrived at
the old homestead just as the sun began to set. It wasn’t long until the
bitter cold began to set in. After subsiding during the day, the wind
returned and blew much harder than before. Racing against the dark,
I roasted some potatoes and beef in aluminum foil while my friend wolfed
down a military ration. As the temperature dipped below freezing,
we retired to the cabin where would spend our first long winter night
in the wilderness.</p>



<p>
I stayed up for some time listening to the wind lash at the
simple stone structure. Assuming we survived, this trip would have
one of two impacts on my friend: Either he would fall in love with
backpacking, or he would never dare to trust me on a trip again. 
</p>


<p>
I woke up at two in the morning. The cold, creeping through the
uninsulated walls, had woken me up. I walked outside, took some icy
logs from a woodpile, and brought them into our small shelter, the
frozen ground crunching under my boots. Inside, I lit a wood burning
stove that rested in the corner. From the soft glow of the coals, I
saw my friend's wide grin. Then, I knew we would hike again.
