    It took me quite some time to clean all the smoke and
    ash that had drifted from Altadena into my bathroom and other
    slightly moist areas of the apartment. It is a little odd to think
    that someone's house was now sprinkled on my windowsills,
    or that a tiny bit of Madlib's personal record collection could
    now be coating the inside crevices of my lungs, waiting dormant
    for a few decades before deciding to smite me with a nice tumor.

    I stopped my tutoring gigs for a couple of months due to all of the
    evacuations and other disturbances. We've since resumed, but I am
    no longer allowed to engage in my post-tutoring hobby of driving
    down to PCH, turning up towards Malibu, and taking Sunset all the
    way home. For some reason the National Guard is not comfortable with
    people driving 2008 Nissan Altima Coupes at 10PM through the evacuation
    zones. It's too bad, because nothing beats playing <em>Roadhouse Blues</em>
    as you approach the fun long part of PCH that curves off towards the west,
    with the mansion lights twinkling on the right and the black blot of
    the ocean on the left.

    The main reason I would play The Doors so often in the car was due
    to a convenient market that opened up in 2023. Ruben was studying
    abroad in Spain, needed some cash, and had no use for his old car.
    I was starting my MS, figured that I should finally learn to drive,
    and had some internship money burning a hole in my pocket.
    The one obstacle to closing this transaction was the fact that
    Ruben was already in Spain by the time I returned to L.A. Thankfully,
    Ruben's very business-savvy mom was willing to complete the physical
    exchange, and I got to feel very cool handing her a fat envelope of
    cash in her dining room.

    Their house is in the back of a dusty courtyard in one of the
    dozens of inner-ring Latino suburbs of LA, with several other
    family members and unrelated renters living in the various
    adjacent units. I think Ruben's mom owns the entire complex,
    which was fun because it made me feel like I was getting some
    special deal from a powerful business person or mafia member.
    She spent a considerable amount of energy prepping the car for
    sale, but didn't remove the collection of CDs that Ruben
    left in the 6-disk audio system. <em>Morrison Hotel</em> was housed
    in Disk 1. Thus, my longer commutes tend to start with
    <em>Roadhouse Blues</em>.

    I will not disagree with the common sentiment that driving in Los
    Angeles in the daytime is a grueling and generally unpleasant
    experience. I'm lucky enough that I don't have much reason to be
    driving around the area during the middle of the weekdays. I lived
    in walking distance to campus during the first year of the MS program
    and mostly only drove to friends and family outside of LA at night.
    This year I mostly commute on the bus.

    However, driving at night, gives me a sense of the vision the last
    generation had for what an automobile experience should be in
    Los Angeles. The roads are empty enough that you can drive
    at (or above...) the speed limit, and the vast expanses of
    the LA basin become immediately more accessible and interesting.
    It makes it a bit easier to be spontaneous: getting Carnitas
    Michoacan at midnight or some coffee from Canter's at one,
    perhaps swinging by a warehouse rave at two and heading back to
    Hollywood by five A.M. Not in the same night, of course.

    The ability to explore local sites on a whim with less worry about managing
    the mental overhead of not crashing this physical piece of metal into
    a much more expensive piece of metal was one of the reasons
    I generally enjoyed New York a bit more than Los Angeles in years past,
    but driving late at night re-captures some of that levity. Listening
    to <em>Queen of the Highway</em> with the windows down, feeling the moist
    marine layer roll over the hills, you can feel the presence of time and
    places and people that no longer exist here. Rolling around the moldy
    Westwood apartments, Ruben and I would imagine the creative chaos
    that Jim Morrison or Ray Manzarek instigated along the same streets.
    The comparisons really end there, since I don't think either of them
    spent as much time matching Lisp parentheses as we did at the same age.

    Driving down to Irvine to see Katie after 10 P.M. was just as exciting. Going
    past LAX, you get feel for what should have been the ideal American post-war
    suburban design. Miles upon miles of identical homes with pretty lawns, wide
    roads, cozy drive-thrus. The oil refinery is more exciting to me than the big
    castle at Disneyland. When you finally cross the San Diego Creek and the
    estuary wetlands of Newport Bay, two things hit: The most modern,
    car-adapted-pedestrian-hostile experience in California, and the smell of sagebrush
    and riparian shrubs and trees that trigger some ancient memory of what this
    land looked like when it was mostly peopled by Tongva and Acjachemen folks.
    As you pass over the old arroyos (now chanellized), you get hit with bursts
    of cold air, like ghosts that only come out at night.

	    I've decided to pull the trigger and actually begin publishing some of my writing on my personal site.
	    I'm mostly inspired by <a href="https://blog.tkanarsky.com/"> my good friend Tim's inactive blog</a>,
	    which I suspect was at least partly inspired by the venerable <a href="https://www.crummy.com/nycb">NYCB blog</a>
	    and its musings of dot-com era undergraduate life in the UCLA Computer Science department.
    </p>
    <p>
    The greatest source of impedance to the creation of this site was my recurring decision paralysis. I contemplated
    using one of various blog platforms, but decided to start off with a static HTML version. I might write a simple
    script to set up RSS syndication, but that's not too important to me right now.

    Regarding my current state: I finished up a very fun internship in the Bay Area (thanks Tim for letting
    me live on your floor for three months), visited family in Central America for the first time,
    had my longest non-work non-school break of the past five years, partied with my cousins almost every weekend
    between Thanksgiving and the new year, and moved back to LA to finish
    up my MS. About two days after I moved in began the terrible winds and fires in Pacific Palisades and
    Altadena. 
    </p>

    <p>
    The particulate matter during a wildfire, combined with extremely low humidity, results in a lighting
    and air condition that is very unsettling. Sometime around 2018 I wrote a poem describing my emotional response
    to these conditions after the extensive fires of the previous two years.
    I cannot find it now, and I definitely would not post it until after the fires are contained.
