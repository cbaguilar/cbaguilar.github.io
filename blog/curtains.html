    I now live in New York City. I've enjoyed the city ever since I interned
    here for the first time nearly four years ago. Although I've had very clear
    ideations for my future as a programmer for no less than a dozen years,
    New York did not cross my mind until around the middle of college.

    Currently I live in a two-bedroom apartment with my cousin, who has been
    living in the city for a couple of years now. We live on the third floor of
    what I suspect was once a fairly large townhouse that was chopped into
    several tenement units, then re-merged into apartments with at least one
    bathroom each. Below us lives the super and his family. They occasionally
    grill food on their terrace when the weather is nice (my floor has no
    comparable outdoor space). On the ground floor are two women with whom I've
    interacted once. The awkward angle of the stairs descending to the basement
    force you to crawl with at least three points of contact. In theory the
    lower level would be a nice communal place to hang while waiting for your
    laundry, but much of the space is taken by random items associated with the
    super's contracting business. At night you can feel the rumble of far-off
    trains trains gently shaking the building through the bones of the earth.

    Our apartment is smaller than the places I've lived in Los Angeles, though
    the narrowness of the rooms provides a slightly labyrinthine experience
    that almost makes the floorplan feel more sprawling than my more open
    apartments in Westwood. Plus, the decorations chosen by my cousin and her
    past roommate make the individual corners and walls much more memorable.

    Seeing the joy and life captured in these photos, playbills, and
    (very sickly) houseplants made my bare room (and every room I've lived in
    since high school) seem all the more like a prison cell. Between entering
    college and wrapping up my M.S. I've lived in no less than ten tiny rooms
    of minimal decoration.

    Knowing that I would leave any apartment at the end of a school year or
    internship made me very hesitant to invest in permanent comforts like lamps or physical textbooks.
    As such, almost as soon as I got the keys to the N.Y.C apartment I
    successfully scoured Facebook marketplace for the corporeal version of my
    favorite PDFs and picked up a couple of nice lights of an industrial-chic
    variety off the sidewalk.

    Until maybe 2021 I had the vision of getting decent undergrad grades,
    and then working at some defense company in Palmdale or (if I was lucky)
    perhaps living a car-free life near the Google Venice office. Perhaps I
    would be a conscientious gentrifier renting a room from my aunt in Fruitvale
    and taking BART to the S.F. office of some IoT startup.
