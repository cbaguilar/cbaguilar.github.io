    One of my common petty sources of annoyance in grade school was
    when people would see something I did and falsely assume it was
    a reference to some piece of mass media. I did not grow up with
    access to cable and did not watch very many movies with my parents,
    and I was pretty proud to say that many of my personal decisions
    came out of creativity or direct contact with friends.

    Sometime around 2010 my dad bought me a fake beard and a helmet with
    plastic hollow horns on it from Spirit Halloween. These two
    accessories, when combined with some natural fiber shirts and
    a sheepskin rug that one of my Mexican uncles gave us, facilitated
    a very fun and easy to wear viking costume that I wore for several
    years. I loved wearing that costume, but it alwasy bothered me
    that other kids would assume that I was trying to be a character
    from Dreamworks' <em>How to Train your Dragon</em>.

    The winter across 2017 and '18 was unusually wet and rainy in Southern
    California.
