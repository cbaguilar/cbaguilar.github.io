            <p> Helo! I'm Christian, a masters student at UCLA
                currently studying Computer Science. My broad interests
                include networking, operating systems, driver development,
                IoT, and full-stack system design.

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>UCLA Water Technologies Research Center. 2020-Present</h3>

            <p>
                I currently work with the UCLA Water Technologies Research
                (WaTeR) Center on their distributed water treatment project
                in the Salinas Valley. During my undergraduate years, I designed
                and implemented several major components for the project's
                "cyberinfrastructure." This included a REST API to collect
                sensor data from hundreds of devices in the field, integration
                with MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases for sensor data storage,
                and a web application to remotely monitor the water treatment
                systems and download sensor data for scientific analysis.

            <h3>Google Cloud Software Engineering Intern. Sunnyvale, Summer 2023</h3>
            <p> 
                I had the wonderful opportunity of working with platforms teams
                at Google Cloud. My project focused on writing PCIe-level simulations
                of new network hardware being developed for Google Cloud.
                Much of my summer involved learning about PCIe, writing
                QEMU simulations, and debugging interactions with the Linux Kernel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my work was done in C. I got to work with the
                <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/next/networking/device_drivers/ethernet/intel/idpf.html">IDPF Driver,</a> which was pretty exciting as it is still
                    in development.
            </p>

            <h3>D.E. Shaw & Co. Systems Technologist Intern. New York, Summer 2022</h3>
            <p>
                My summer at D.E. Shaw was spent working with systems teams to
                develop a new tool to manage highly available distributed
                timeseries databases. This was my first real exposure to
                PostgreSQL and distributed systems. Most of my code was in
                Golang with some shell scripts used to automate deployment.
                This was a neat experience in independently designing, developing, and
                testing a new tool from scratch.
            </p>

            <h3>WhatsApp (Meta) Software Engineering Intern. Menlo Park/Remote, Summer 2021</h3>
            <p>
                I worked with the WhatsApp Business API team. I contributed to
                the implementation of the new cloud-based WhatsApp Business API,
                which was publicly released a few months after my internship.
                This was a very fun opportunity to work with a large codebase
                and follow the development of a new product from its early stages.
            </p>   
            <p>
                My main contribution was the implementation of route selection
                for media messages (stickers, images, videos, etc.). This involved
                a very fun deep dive into the WhatsApp media pipeline and
                interactions between old and new back-end systems.
            </p>

            <h3>NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Intern. Remote, Summer 2020, Spring 2021</h3>
            <p>
                My first software internships were with section 332H at JPL.
                This group focused on interplanetary communications. My internship
                focused on developing software to interact with
                <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/interplanetary-overlay-network/">
                    ION</a>, JPL's implementation of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-tolerant_networking">
                Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN).</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                My summer project involved developing an extension to ION to
                support opportunisic message routing following the
                <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1080139.1080143">
                    "Spray and Wait"</a>
                algorithm. The ION codebase, which is written in C,
                is designed to be very platform-agnostic with a particular
                emphasis on supporting RTOS environments on flight computers.
                As a result, the codebase acts almost like a mini operating system,
                so I gained experience with many OS concepts such as
                sempahores, mutexes, message queues, and managing shared
                memory. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I returned to JPL in the spring to work with PyION, a Python
                wrapper for ION. At the beginning of my internship, there
                existed conflicts between the memory management system of
                ION and Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).I interned
                part-time refactoring the PyION codebase to resolve these
                conflicts. Since PyION is a C python extension, 
                this internship gave me a cool opportunity to think about
                ownership, object lifetimes, and memory management in C.
